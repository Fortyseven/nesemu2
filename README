nesemu2 -- Cycle accurate nes emulator for Win32/Linux/OSX

Building with make
------------------
There are many build options available.  You can build for Win32, Linux and OSX.
Some options are:

   CPU_UNDOC        - Enable the undocumented opcodes.
   QUICK_SPRITES    - Use the fast sprite code.
   ACCURATE_SPRITE0 - Enable perfect sprite0 emulation, use with QUICK_SPRITES

      * All of these are currently enabled by default.

The build target is automatically determined by the makefile.  Linux/OSX must use
the SDL library.  For Win32 just specify USESDL=0 on the command line to build the
Win32 API version.  Here are some example command lines for building:

   To build using the default options and autodetect your OS.
      $ make
      
   For building the Win32 API version.
      $ make USESDL=0

   Enabling the undocumented opcodes.
      $ make CPU_UNDOC=1

   Forcing to build on a specific OS.
      $ make OSTARGET=OSX

   Building on forced Win32, undocument opcodes and fast sprites enabled.
      $ make OSTARGET=WIN32 CPU_UNDOC=1 QUICK_SPRITES=1

Basic Usage
-----------
Just run it like this:

   $ ./nesemu2 <ines/ines 2.0/unif/fds file>
   
The Win32 API target operates like a standard Win32 program.  Use File -> Open.

Configuration Files
-------------------
The program will search for configuration files to use.  It looks for it like this:

  1.  Check the current working directory for nesemu2.cfg
  2.  If the HOME environment variable is set, it tries ~/.nesemu/nesemu2.cfg
  3.  (Win32 only) Check the directory the .exe is stored in.
  
If it is not found, it creates it in:

  Win32:  The same directory as the executable.
  Linux/OSX:  The users home directory (~/.nesemu/nesemu2.cfg)

If you do not like any of these locations, you can use --config <filename> as a
command line parameter.
