Building with make
------------------
There are many build options available.  You can build for Win32, Linux and OSX.
Some options are:

   CPU_UNDOC        - Enable the undocumented opcodes.
   QUICK_SPRITES    - Use the fast sprite code.
   ACCURATE_SPRITE0 - Enable perfect sprite0 emulation, use with QUICK_SPRITES

      * All of these are currently enabled by default.

The build target is automatically determined by the makefile.  Linux/OSX must use
the SDL library.  For Win32 just specify USESDL=0 on the command line to build the
Win32 API version.  Here are some example command lines for building:

   To build using the default options and autodetect your OS.
      $ make
      
   For building the Win32 API version.
      $ make USESDL=0

   Enabling the undocumented opcodes.
      $ make CPU_UNDOC=1

   Forcing to build on a specific OS.
      $ make OSTARGET=OSX

   Building on forced Win32, undocument opcodes and fast sprites enabled.
      $ make OSTARGET=WIN32 CPU_UNDOC=1 QUICK_SPRITES=1

Basic Usage
-----------
Just run it like this:

   $ ./nesemu2 <ines/ines 2.0/unif/fds file>
   
The Win32 API target operates like a standard Win32 program.  Use File -> Open.

Configuration Files
-------------------
The program will search for configuration files to use, and if one isn't found it
will put the configuration in the same directory as the executable.

Be careful with the variables in the configuration files.  Do not have a variable
reference itself, for example:

   path.roms = %path.roms%/new
  
The program will die.  There is no need to reference itself anyway.
