nes
 . something is wrong with reset!

cpu
 . add the BRK + NMI bug
 . branch + interrupts
 
ppu
 . $2005/6 masks for internal scroll temp register (bit15 is ok?)
 . dirty buffer system for cache + vram...NECESSARY ASAP (wizards & warriors)
 . make the other two nametables for four screen handled by cart, not ppu
 ! we are allowing writes to chr-rom because of cache system
 . instead of using the 'fetchpos' variable, calculate where tile data goes

mappers
 ! better method of changing mapper dips
 . find mapper 172/173 games to test (TXC-22211B + TXC-22211C)
 . find mapper 206 (dxrom) games to test
 . mapper 88/206 (dxrom) needs work
 . what is mapper 150?
 . sachen 74ls374 broken (chess academy)
 . sachen 0036 broken (chr problems!) (taiwan mahjong 16)
 . sachen 0037 broken...why?
 . implement different mmc3 types
 . mapper 65 (irem h3001) "Daiku no Gen San 2 - Akage no Dan no Gyakushuu" graphical garbage.
   --possibly related to bad timing?  mapper seems implemented ok.
 . finish strikewolf mapper
 . devil man broken (namcot 3453)
 . finish the namcot 108 based mappers
 . unl-h2288 (earthworm jim) broken
 . mmc5 needs finishing (just breed fails)
 . get roms to test the homebrew 'tepples' mapper and finish it
 . dripgame mostly works.  need to add sound and remove the hack.
 . finish mapper 205 (should be working?)
 . fk23c mapper is nightmare!  need documents!
 . mapper 82 (taito x1-017) working except for "Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium 3"
 . mapper 47 (nes-qj) needs $A001 register write disable
 . test mappers 67/68/69 more

mappers working
 . perfect:  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 42

misc
 . implement reading of the xml rom databases
 . go thru and fix the hard/soft reset code, not everything checks for hard
