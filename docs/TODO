cpu
 . add the BRK + NMI bug
 . branch + interrupts
 ! timing off somewhere by one cpu cycle (ppu_vbl_nmi test 7 indicates)
 
ppu
 . $2005/6 masks for internal scroll temp register (bit15 is ok?)
 . $2002 nmi suppression
 . dirty buffer system for cache + vram...NECESSARY ASAP (wizards & warriors)
 . make the other two nametables for four screen handled by cart, not ppu
 ! we are allowing writes to chr-rom because of cache system
 . sprites need more work (to allow mmc5 to work properly)
